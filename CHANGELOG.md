# [0.0.17] - 04-03-2023

## NodeProperty<T>s, Blackboard Overrides, Switch Node

The NodeProperty class replaces the BlackboardProperty class, allowing node variables to be specified on the node, or optionally bind them directly to a blackboard key value.

### Changed features
- Renamed BlackboardProperty to NodeProperty
- Added a default value to the NodeProperty class
- Exposing a NodeProperty variable on a node allows the value to be specified on the node instance or bind it to a blackboard key.
- Added blackboard key overrides to the BehaviourTreeInstance component allowing blackboard key values to be override at the game object level.
- Added a new Switch composite node which allows executing a specific child based on an index value.

# [0.0.16] - 02-03-2023

## Runtime Blackboard Key support

Added runtime support for reading and writing blackboard values from components.

See BehaviourTreeInstance:
- SetBlackboardValue<T>
- GetBlackboardValue<T>
- FindBlackboardKey<T>

### Changed features
- Renamed BehaviourTreeRunner to BehaviourTreeInstance
- Changed behaviour tree initialisation from Start to Awake
- Added missing string blackboard key type
- Added SetBlackboardValue<T> method to BehaviourTreeInstance
- Added GetBlackboardValue<T> method to BehaviourTreeInstance
- Added FindBlackboardKey<T> method to BehaviourTreeInstance
- Added custom icon to BehaviourTreeInstance MonoBehaviour

# [0.0.15] - 01-03-2023

## Blackboard Refactor

The blackboard has been refactored significantly to support many more types, including any custom types defined in a project.

Note this will break any previously defined blackboard keys in your tree so you'll need to recreate them and assign them to a node.

Additionally, there are two new nodes:
- SetProperty
- CompareProperty

These nodes can be placed in a tree and used to set an arbitary blackboard key to a specific value, or compare a key to a specific value respectively.

### Changed features

- Added BlackboardProperty<T> type for reading and writing blackboard keys from nodes.
- Added generic BlackboardKey<T> type. Subclass this type to add support for custom types to the blackboard.
- Fixed editor assembly definition to only build for the editor.

# [0.0.14] - 01-03-2023
